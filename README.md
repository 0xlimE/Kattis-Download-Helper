# Kattis-Download-Helper
A python script I made to download all your own ACCEPTED solutions into the working directory of the script. 

# How To:
*Get your session cookie from firefox/chrome and insert into the code in the top.

*Get your user name and inser into the code in the top.

*Run the script, it is not threaded so if you have a lot of points (more than 1000) it might take a while.
